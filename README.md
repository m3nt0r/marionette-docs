marionette-docs (UNOFFICIAL) 
============================

Backbone Marionette documentation as GitHub Pages project

I've found the browsing through /docs a bit awkward and as far as i know
there is no current official documentation website. I saw all the .md files 
and thought that i should be able to run them through Jekyll and get something
acceptable. 

Fortunately i was right and with just minor changes (frontmatter,date-prefix) i
was able to use the files 1:1.

I did this just for personal use and i am not affiliated in any way. I hope they 
will forgive me using the logo, but otherwise it would have looked a bit boring.

Enjoy!
